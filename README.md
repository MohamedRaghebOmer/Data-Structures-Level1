# 🚀 Core-Data-Structures

This repository marks a transition from basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to **low-level Software Engineering**. It contains a hand-crafted library of fundamental Data Structures, implemented from scratch in C++, with a strong focus on memory efficiency, template-based design, and algorithmic optimization.

## 💎 Technical Highlights

What makes this repository "Advanced"?
* **Template-Based Design:** Every structure is generic, supporting any data type through C++ Templates.
* **Manual Memory Management:** Direct manipulation of heap memory using `new` and `delete`, ensuring zero memory leaks through careful destructor logic.
* **The Adapter Pattern:** Implementing Stacks and Queues by "adapting" existing structures like Linked Lists and Dynamic Arrays, demonstrating code reusability.
* **Algorithmic Rigor:** All operations  are analyzed and documented based on their **Big O Notation** performance.

## 🛠 Implemented Structures & Complexity

I have implemented the following core components, ensuring each adheres to strict performance standards:

### 1. Doubly Linked List (`clsDblLinkedList`)
A robust bidirectional list allowing efficient navigation in both directions.
* **Logic:** Node-based architecture with `Next` and `Prev` pointers.
* **Advanced Features:** In-place list reversal, complex node deletion, and safe index-based access.



### 2. Custom Dynamic Array (`clsDynamicArray`)
A manual implementation of a vector-like structure.
* **Logic:** Handles raw array resizing, element shifting during insertion/deletion, and memory reallocation.
* **Optimization:** Includes methods for shrinking to fit and batch updates.

### 3. Stack & Queue (The Adapters)
Built as abstraction layers over the base structures.
* **`clsMyStack`**: LIFO logic (Last-In-First-Out).
* **`clsMyQueue`**: FIFO logic (First-In-First-Out).
* **`clsMyStackArr` / `clsMyQueueArr`**: Alternative implementations using arrays to compare performance trade-offs.
